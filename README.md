# Device Tree

## Introduction

This repository is intended for personal education and experimentation with device tree configurations. Device trees are essential in embedded systems for describing the hardware components and their configurations. This project aims to help understand the structure, usage, and customization of device trees.

## Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Learn how device tree files are structured and used in embedded systems.
- Experiment with various configurations to see how they affect the system.
- Gain practical experience with device tree syntax and functionality.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/device-tree`**: Contains device tree source files and related configurations.
