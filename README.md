# Device Tree

## Introduction

This repository is intended for personal education and experimentation with device tree configurations. Device trees are essential in embedded systems for describing the hardware components and their configurations. This project aims to help understand the structure, usage, and customization of device trees.

## Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Learn how device tree files are structured and used in embedded systems.
- Experiment with various configurations to see how they affect the system.
- Gain practical experience with device tree syntax and functionality.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### `.gitattributes`
- **Purpose:** Defines Git attributes to control how Git handles files in the repository.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Attribute Definitions:** Settings for file handling, such as line endings, merge strategies, and text encoding.

### `Android.bp`
- **Purpose:** Build configuration file used by the Blueprint build system.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Blueprint Rules:** Definitions of modules, dependencies, and build instructions in the Blueprint format.

### `Android.mk`
- **Purpose:** Makefile used by the older Android build system.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Build Instructions:** Rules and instructions for building Android modules using GNU Make.

### `AndroidProducts.mk`
- **Purpose:** Defines the products being built.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Product Definitions:** Configuration for various product variants and their build settings.

### `BoardConfig.mk`
- **Purpose:** Board-specific configuration file.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Board Settings:** Configuration specific to the hardware board, including filesystem mount options (`fstab`) and other board-specific settings.

### `device.mk`
- **Purpose:** Device-specific Makefile.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Device Configuration:** Flags and settings specific to the device being built, such as performance settings, service flags, and boot configurations.

### `extract-files.sh`
- **Purpose:** Script for extracting proprietary files from a device.
- **Typical Contents:**
  - **Extraction Commands:** Shell commands or scripts to pull proprietary binaries and files from a device for use in building custom images.

### `lineage_sky.mk`
- **Purpose:** Makefile related to building LineageOS for the Sky device.
- **Typical Contents:**
